# Project Algorithm Machine Learning
Project as part of the "AI Methods" course taught by [Yvenn Amara](https://www.yvenn-amara.com/teaching/) in the first year of the [Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence master](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/fr/etudiants/masters/mathematiques-et-applications/m1/mathematiques-et-intelligence-artificielle/)'s program. 

Use of supervised learning methods, in particular deep learning, to predict games of the online game Ligue of legends as a function of various parameters more or less advanced in the game.

## Experiment
We evaluate the model with ROC curves (receiver operating characteristic) to evaluate predictions of the models after splitting the data into a training and a test set.

## Use
Every model used is available in the jupyter notebook aswell as the data used (taken from Kaggle).
